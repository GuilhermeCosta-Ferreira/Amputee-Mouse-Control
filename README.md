# Amputee Mouse Control
In the Principles of Bioinstrumentation course, we developed an accelerometer-based digital interface for upper limb amputees. With this proof of concept, we aimed to improve the connection of these patients to the everyday computer, allowing them to sweeten their workflow and hopefully establish new ways to reconnect with the work environment.
