# Amputee Mouse Control
In the Principles of Bioinstrumentation course, we developed an accelerometer-based digital interface for upper limb amputees. With this proof of concept, we aimed to improve the connection of these patients to the everyday computer, allowing them to sweeten their workflow and hopefully establish new ways to reconnect with the work environment.

You can check how the project works by inspecting the videos. One of the has the acceleration setting on ([video 1](./Videos/yes_accel.mp4)) while the other is with the default settings ([video 2](./Videos/no_accel.mov)).
